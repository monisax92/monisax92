# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Monika

I'm a mathematician turned self-taught frontend web developer, passionate about building useful, user-focused apps and constantly expanding my skills.

ðŸ§  My math background gives me a strong foundation in logic, critical thinking, and detail-oriented problem solving. Iâ€™m organized, independent, and enjoy learning by building real projects, while never forgetting the importance of strong theoretical understanding.

ðŸ’» I primarily work with JavaScript and modern frontend frameworks like React, and I'm currently expanding into Next.js and the Node.js ecosystem. I also have experience using tools like MongoDB and Firebase in some of my projects, and a solid grasp of HTML and CSS.

ðŸ”§ In the past, Iâ€™ve also worked with Java, R, SQL, Matlab, and taught the basics of C and C++. These experiences help me see patterns and adapt quickly across technologies.

ðŸŒ± I'm always growing â€” and Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to gain real-world experience and contribute to meaningful projects.
